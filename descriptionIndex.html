    <h1>Description of the Drama</h1>
    <p>The film <strong>Violet and Finch</strong> tells us about two young people who are in a vulnerable moment. For Violet, she did not have much, as her sister had died in a car accident. She was on the edge of a bridge when Finch found her there and saved her.</p>
    <p>From that moment, Finch was with Violet all the time. He taught her how to live, that being different from others is not bad, that people are bothered by noise, that they call different "weird". He taught her to see life in a different way. But she did not realize that he was suffering, that he was fighting in silence, that he was just giving her a push so that she could go out into the world alone. He showed her that it’s okay to disappear as long as you can come back. Finch disappeared many times, but the last time, he could not return.</p>
