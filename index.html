            <h2>Description of the Drama</h2>
            <p>The film tells us about two young people who are in a vulnerable moment, especially Violet, whose sister had recently died in a car accident. Finch finds her at the edge of a bridge and saves her, then teaches her how to live differently. Though Finch himself was silently suffering, he helped Violet emerge stronger, even if he couldn’t return after disappearing for the last time.</p>

            <h2>Why did I decide to watch the film?</h2>
            <p>I decided to watch the movie because I was going through a tough time emotionally. The trailer caught my attention, and I found that it teaches many lessons about how people around us may suffer in silence without us realizing it.</p>

        <div id="scene-reason" class="section">
            <h2>Why did you choose that scene?</h2>
            <p>This scene left a big impression on me. It shows that everyone has internal battles, but some people come into our lives to help us, even if they are struggling themselves. They teach us to live, even if they can’t always stay.</p>
